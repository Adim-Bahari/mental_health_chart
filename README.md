#Mental Health Data Visualizations

This repository contains a series of interactive charts and dashboards exploring global mental health trends. Created as part of a personal initiative to raise awareness and support silent voices, this project blends data, design, and empathy.

#Why I Created This

I decided to create this platform in response to the rising global cases of mental illness and the heartbreaking number of lives lost to it. 
Behind every statistic is a story, often unheard, often unseen. This project is my way of reaching out to those silent voices, offering a space where they can feel safe, supported, and understood.
